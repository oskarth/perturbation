* Perturbation Theory
** 1. History and introduction
   Write this last.
** 2. Simple regular perturbation
   A simple quadratic example.
*** Show intuition with exact.
*** Follow Lin and Segels Series method
    Assume expansion in a series of powers of the small variable.
    Step A) Substitute the power series...
    Step B) Expand all quantities....
    Step C) Collect all terms...
    Step D) Substitute power series...
    Step E) Successivelly solve...
** 3. Simple singular perturbation
   Same as before but a singular one. Requires rewrite.
** 4. ODE example
   We start with a neat problem formulation already.
*** Outer solution
    Naively set epsilon to 0. ICs can't be met.
*** Boundary layer
    Layer thickness, boundary-layer coordinate, Pairwise balancing -
    same as dominant matching from Bender and Orszag?
*** Matching
    Two separate time scales. Limit where they meet.
*** Composite expansion
    Common part minus difference.
** 5. TQSSA A biological application
*** Biological background
*** Scaling
    Turn into a math problem.
**** Time scales
     Khoo and Hegland takes these for granted. We can derive them.
*** Outer solution
*** Inner solution
*** Matching
*** Composite expansion
